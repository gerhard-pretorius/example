Then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief And this is
a lesson which I suspect you must have learnt out of Homer for he
speaking of Autolycus the maternal grandfather of Odysseus who is a
favourite of his affirms that

He was excellent above all men in theft and perjury

And so you and Homer and Simonides are agreed that justice is an art of
theft to be practised however for the good of friends and for the harm
of enemiesthat was what you were saying

No certainly not that though I do not now know what I did say but I
still stand by the latter words

Well there is another question By friends and enemies do we mean those
who are so really or only in seeming

Surely he said a man may be expected to love those whom he thinks
good and to hate those whom he thinks evil

Yes but do not persons often err about good and evil many who are not
good seem to be so and conversely

That is true

Then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be their
friends True

And in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and evil
to the good

Clearly

But the good are just and would not do an injustice

True

Then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do no
wrong

Nay Socrates the doctrine is immoral

Then I suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the
unjust

I like that better

But see the consequenceMany a man who is ignorant of human nature
has friends who are bad friends and in that case he ought to do harm to
them and he has good enemies whom he ought to benefit but if so we
shall be saying the very opposite of that which we affirmed to be the
meaning of Simonides

Very true he said and I think that we had better correct an error
into which we seem to have fallen in the use of the words friend and
enemy

What was the error Polemarchus I asked

We assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thought good

And how is the error to be corrected

We should rather say that he is a friend who is as well as seems good
and that he who seems only and is not good only seems to be and is not
a friend and of an enemy the same may be said

You would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our enemies

Yes

And instead of saying simply as we did at first that it is just to do
good to our friends and harm to our enemies we should further say It
is just to do good to our friends when they are good and harm to our
enemies when they are evil

Yes that appears to me to be the truth

But ought the just to injure any one at all

Undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and his
enemies

When horses are injured are they improved or deteriorated

The latter

Deteriorated that is to say in the good qualities of horses not of
dogs

Yes of horses

And dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs and not of
horses

Of course

And will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which is the
proper virtue of man

Certainly

And that human virtue is justice

To be sure

Then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust

That is the result

But can the musician by his art make men unmusical

Certainly not

Or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen

Impossible

And can the just by justice make men unjust or speaking generally can
the good by virtue make them bad

Assuredly not

Any more than heat can produce cold

It cannot

Or drought moisture

Clearly not

Nor can the good harm any one

Impossible

And the just is the good

Certainly

Then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man
but of the opposite who is the unjust

I think that what you say is quite true Socrates

Then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment of debts and
that good is the debt which a just man owes to his friends and evil the
debt which he owes to his enemiesto say this is not wise for it is
not true if as has been clearly shown the injuring of another can be
in no case just

I agree with you said Polemarchus

Then you and I are prepared to take up arms against any one who
attributes such a saying to Simonides or Bias or Pittacus or any other
wise man or seer

I am quite ready to do battle at your side he said

Shall I tell you whose I believe the saying to be

Whose

I believe that Periander or Perdiccas or Xerxes or Ismenias the Theban
or some other rich and mighty man who had a great opinion of his own
power was the first to say that justice is doing good to your friends
and harm to your enemies

Most true he said

Yes I said but if this definition of justice also breaks down what
other can be offered

Several times in the course of the discussion Thrasymachus had made an
attempt to get the argument into his own hands and had been put down
by the rest of the company who wanted to hear the end But when
Polemarchus and I had done speaking and there was a pause he could no
longer hold his peace and gathering himself up he came at us like a
wild beast seeking to devour us We were quite panicstricken at the
sight of him

He roared out to the whole company What folly Socrates has taken
possession of you all And why sillybillies do you knock under to
one another I say that if you want really to know what justice is
you should not only ask but answer and you should not seek honour to
yourself from the refutation of an opponent but have your own answer
for there is many a one who can ask and cannot answer And now I will
not have you say that justice is duty or advantage or profit or gain
or interest for this sort of nonsense will not do for me I must have
clearness and accuracy

I was panicstricken at his words and could not look at him without
trembling Indeed I believe that if I had not fixed my eye upon him I
should have been struck dumb but when I saw his fury rising I looked
at him first and was therefore able to reply to him

Thrasymachus I said with a quiver dont be hard upon us Polemarchus
and I may have been guilty of a little mistake in the argument but I
can assure you that the error was not intentional If we were seeking
for a piece of gold you would not imagine that we were knocking under
to one another and so losing our chance of finding it And why when
we are seeking for justice a thing more precious than many pieces of
gold do you say that we are weakly yielding to one another and not
doing our utmost to get at the truth Nay my good friend we are most
willing and anxious to do so but the fact is that we cannot And if so
you people who know all things should pity us and not be angry with us

How characteristic of Socrates he replied with a bitter laugh thats
your ironical style Did I not foreseehave I not already told you
that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer and try irony or
any other shuffle in order that he might avoid answering

You are a philosopher Thrasymachus I replied and well know that if
you ask a person what numbers make up twelve taking care to prohibit
him whom you ask from answering twice six or three times four or six
times two or four times three for this sort of nonsense will not do
for methen obviously if that is your way of putting the
question no one can answer you But suppose that he were to retort
Thrasymachus what do you mean If one of these numbers which you
interdict be the true answer to the question am I falsely to say some
other number which is not the right oneis that your meaning How
would you answer him

Just as if the two cases were at all alike he said

Why should they not be I replied and even if they are not but only
appear to be so to the person who is asked ought he not to say what he
thinks whether you and I forbid him or not

I presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted
answers

I dare say that I may notwithstanding the danger if upon reflection I
approve of any of them

But what if I give you an answer about justice other and better he
said than any of these What do you deserve to have done to you

Done to meas becomes the ignorant I must learn from the wisethat
is what I deserve to have done to me

What and no payment a pleasant notion

I will pay when I have the money I replied

But you have Socrates said Glaucon and you Thrasymachus need be
under no anxiety about money for we will all make a contribution for
Socrates

Yes he replied and then Socrates will do as he always doesrefuse to
answer himself but take and pull to pieces the answer of some one else

Why my good friend I said how can any one answer who knows and says
that he knows just nothing and who even if he has some faint notions
of his own is told by a man of authority not to utter them The
natural thing is that the speaker should be some one like yourself
who professes to know and can tell what he knows Will you then kindly
answer for the edification of the company and of myself

Glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request and
Thrasymachus as any one might see was in reality eager to speak
for he thought that he had an excellent answer and would distinguish
himself But at first he affected to insist on my answering at length
he consented to begin Behold he said the wisdom of Socrates he
refuses to teach himself and goes about learning of others to whom he
never even says Thank you

That I learn of others I replied is quite true but that I am
ungrateful I wholly deny Money I have none and therefore I pay in
praise which is all I have and how ready I am to praise any one who
appears to me to speak well you will very soon find out when you answer
for I expect that you will answer well

Listen then he said I proclaim that justice is nothing else than
the interest of the stronger And now why do you not praise me But of
course you wont

Let me first understand you I replied Justice as you say is the
interest of the stronger What Thrasymachus is the meaning of this
You cannot mean to say that because Polydamas the pancratiast is
stronger than we are and finds the eating of beef conducive to his
bodily strength that to eat beef is therefore equally for our good who
are weaker than he is and right and just for us

Thats abominable of you Socrates you take the words in the sense
which is most damaging to the argument

Not at all my good sir I said I am trying to understand them and I
wish that you would be a little clearer

Well he said have you never heard that forms of government differ
there are tyrannies and there are democracies and there are
aristocracies

Yes I know

And the government is the ruling power in each state

Certainly

And the different forms of government make laws democratical
aristocratical tyrannical with a view to their several interests
and these laws which are made by them for their own interests are the
justice which they deliver to their subjects and him who transgresses
them they punish as a breaker of the law and unjust And that is what
I mean when I say that in all states there is the same principle of
justice which is the interest of the government and as the government
must be supposed to have power the only reasonable conclusion is that
everywhere there is one principle of justice which is the interest of
the stronger

Now I understand you I said and whether you are right or not I will
try to discover But let me remark that in defining justice you have
yourself used the word interest which you forbade me to use It is
true however that in your definition the words of the stronger are
added

A small addition you must allow he said

Great or small never mind about that we must first enquire whether
what you are saying is the truth Now we are both agreed that justice
is interest of some sort but you go on to say of the stronger about
this addition I am not so sure and must therefore consider further

Proceed

I will and first tell me Do you admit that it is just for subjects to
obey their rulers

I do

But are the rulers of states absolutely infallible or are they
sometimes liable to err

To be sure he replied they are liable to err

Then in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly and
sometimes not

True

When they make them rightly they make them agreeably to their interest
when they are mistaken contrary to their interest you admit that

Yes

And the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjectsand that
is what you call justice

Doubtless

Then justice according to your argument is not only obedience to the
interest of the stronger but the reverse

What is that you are saying he asked

I am only repeating what you are saying I believe But let us consider
Have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about their own
interest in what they command and also that to obey them is justice
Has not that been admitted

Yes

Then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for the interest
of the stronger when the rulers unintentionally command things to be
done which are to their own injury For if as you say justice is the
obedience which the subject renders to their commands in that case O
wisest of men is there any escape from the conclusion that the weaker
are commanded to do not what is for the interest but what is for the
injury of the stronger

Nothing can be clearer Socrates said Polemarchus

Yes said Cleitophon interposing if you are allowed to be his witness

But there is no need of any witness said Polemarchus for Thrasymachus
himself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not for
their own interest and that for subjects to obey them is justice

Yes PolemarchusThrasymachus said that for subjects to do what was
commanded by their rulers is just

Yes Cleitophon but he also said that justice is the interest of the
stronger and while admitting both these propositions he further
acknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are his
subjects to do what is not for his own interest whence follows that
justice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger

But said Cleitophon he meant by the interest of the stronger what the
stronger thought to be his interestthis was what the weaker had to
do and this was affirmed by him to be justice

Those were not his words rejoined Polemarchus

Never mind I replied if he now says that they are let us accept his
statement Tell me Thrasymachus I said did you mean by justice what
the stronger thought to be his interest whether really so or not

Certainly not he said Do you suppose that I call him who is mistaken
the stronger at the time when he is mistaken
