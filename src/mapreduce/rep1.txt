I went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston
that I might offer up my prayers to the goddess Bendis the Thracian
Artemis and also because I wanted to see in what manner they would
celebrate the festival which was a new thing I was delighted with the
procession of the inhabitants but that of the Thracians was equally
if not more beautiful When we had finished our prayers and viewed the
spectacle we turned in the direction of the city and at that instant
Polemarchus the son of Cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from a
distance as we were starting on our way home and told his servant to
run and bid us wait for him The servant took hold of me by the cloak
behind and said Polemarchus desires you to wait

I turned round and asked him where his master was

There he is said the youth coming after you if you will only wait

Certainly we will said Glaucon and in a few minutes Polemarchus
appeared and with him Adeimantus Glaucons brother Niceratus the son
of Nicias and several others who had been at the procession

Polemarchus said to me I perceive Socrates that you and your
companion are already on your way to the city

You are not far wrong I said

But do you see he rejoined how many we are

Of course

And are you stronger than all these for if not you will have to remain
where you are

May there not be the alternative I said that we may persuade you to
let us go

But can you persuade us if we refuse to listen to you he said

Certainly not replied Glaucon

Then we are not going to listen of that you may be assured

Adeimantus added Has no one told you of the torchrace on horseback in
honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening

With horses I replied That is a novelty Will horsemen carry torches
and pass them one to another during the race

Yes said Polemarchus and not only so but a festival will be
celebrated at night which you certainly ought to see Let us rise soon
after supper and see this festival there will be a gathering of young
men and we will have a good talk Stay then and do not be perverse

Glaucon said I suppose since you insist that we must

Very good I replied

Accordingly we went with Polemarchus to his house and there we found
his brothers Lysias and Euthydemus and with them Thrasymachus the
Chalcedonian Charmantides the Paeanian and Cleitophon the son of
Aristonymus There too was Cephalus the father of Polemarchus whom I
had not seen for a long time and I thought him very much aged He was
seated on a cushioned chair and had a garland on his head for he had
been sacrificing in the court and there were some other chairs in the
room arranged in a semicircle upon which we sat down by him He saluted
me eagerly and then he said 

You dont come to see me Socrates as often as you ought If I were
still able to go and see you I would not ask you to come to me But
at my age I can hardly get to the city and therefore you should come
oftener to the Piraeus For let me tell you that the more the pleasures
of the body fade away the greater to me is the pleasure and charm
of conversation Do not then deny my request but make our house your
resort and keep company with these young men we are old friends and
you will be quite at home with us

I replied There is nothing which for my part I like better Cephalus
than conversing with aged men for I regard them as travellers who
have gone a journey which I too may have to go and of whom I ought to
enquire whether the way is smooth and easy or rugged and difficult
And this is a question which I should like to ask of you who have
arrived at that time which the poets call the threshold of old age Is
life harder towards the end or what report do you give of it

I will tell you Socrates he said what my own feeling is Men of my
age flock together we are birds of a feather as the old proverb says
and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly is I cannot
eat I cannot drink the pleasures of youth and love are fled away
there was a good time once but now that is gone and life is no longer
life Some complain of the slights which are put upon them by relations
and they will tell you sadly of how many evils their old age is the
cause But to me Socrates these complainers seem to blame that which
is not really in fault For if old age were the cause I too being old
and every other old man would have felt as they do But this is not
my own experience nor that of others whom I have known How well I
remember the aged poet Sophocles when in answer to the question How
does love suit with age Sophocles are you still the man you were
Peace he replied most gladly have I escaped the thing of which you
speak I feel as if I had escaped from a mad and furious master His
words have often occurred to my mind since and they seem as good to
me now as at the time when he uttered them For certainly old age has
a great sense of calm and freedom when the passions relax their hold
then as Sophocles says we are freed from the grasp not of one mad
master only but of many The truth is Socrates that these regrets
and also the complaints about relations are to be attributed to the
same cause which is not old age but mens characters and tempers for
he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressure of
age but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age are
equally a burden

I listened in admiration and wanting to draw him out that he might go
on Yes Cephalus I said but I rather suspect that people in general
are not convinced by you when you speak thus they think that old
age sits lightly upon you not because of your happy disposition but
because you are rich and wealth is well known to be a great comforter

You are right he replied they are not convinced and there is
something in what they say not however so much as they imagine I
might answer them as Themistocles answered the Seriphian who was abusing
him and saying that he was famous not for his own merits but because he
was an Athenian If you had been a native of my country or I of yours
neither of us would have been famous And to those who are not rich and
are impatient of old age the same reply may be made for to the good
poor man old age cannot be a light burden nor can a bad rich man ever
have peace with himself

May I ask Cephalus whether your fortune was for the most part
inherited or acquired by you

Acquired Socrates do you want to know how much I acquired In the art
of making money I have been midway between my father and grandfather
for my grandfather whose name I bear doubled and trebled the value of
his patrimony that which he inherited being much what I possess now
but my father Lysanias reduced the property below what it is at present
and I shall be satisfied if I leave to these my sons not less but a
little more than I received

That was why I asked you the question I replied because I see that you
are indifferent about money which is a characteristic rather of those
who have inherited their fortunes than of those who have acquired them
the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as a creation of
their own resembling the affection of authors for their own poems or
of parents for their children besides that natural love of it for the
sake of use and profit which is common to them and all men And hence
they are very bad company for they can talk about nothing but the
praises of wealth

That is true he said

Yes that is very true but may I ask another question What do you
consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your
wealth

One he said of which I could not expect easily to convince others
For let me tell you Socrates that when a man thinks himself to be near
death fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had before
the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exacted there
of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him but now he
is tormented with the thought that they may be true either from the
weakness of age or because he is now drawing nearer to that other
place he has a clearer view of these things suspicions and alarms
crowd thickly upon him and he begins to reflect and consider what
wrongs he has done to others And when he finds that the sum of his
transgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up in his
sleep for fear and he is filled with dark forebodings But to him who
is conscious of no sin sweet hope as Pindar charmingly says is the
kind nurse of his age

Hope he says cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice
and holiness and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his
journey hope which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man

How admirable are his words And the great blessing of riches I do not
say to every man but to a good man is that he has had no occasion to
deceive or to defraud others either intentionally or unintentionally
and when he departs to the world below he is not in any apprehension
about offerings due to the gods or debts which he owes to men Now to
this peace of mind the possession of wealth greatly contributes and
therefore I say that setting one thing against another of the many
advantages which wealth has to give to a man of sense this is in my
opinion the greatest

Well said Cephalus I replied but as concerning justice what is
it to speak the truth and to pay your debts no more than this And
even to this are there not exceptions Suppose that a friend when in his
right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he is
not in his right mind ought I to give them back to him No one would
say that I ought or that I should be right in doing so any more than
they would say that I ought always to speak the truth to one who is in
his condition

You are quite right he replied

But then I said speaking the truth and paying your debts is not a
correct definition of justice

Quite correct Socrates if Simonides is to be believed said
Polemarchus interposing

I fear said Cephalus that I must go now for I have to look after the
sacrifices and I hand over the argument to Polemarchus and the company

Is not Polemarchus your heir I said

To be sure he answered and went away laughing to the sacrifices

Tell me then O thou heir of the argument what did Simonides say and
according to you truly say about justice

He said that the repayment of a debt is just and in saying so he
appears to me to be right

I should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired man but
his meaning though probably clear to you is the reverse of clear to
me For he certainly does not mean as we were just now saying that I
ought to return a deposit of arms or of anything else to one who asks
for it when he is not in his right senses and yet a deposit cannot be
denied to be a debt

True

Then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind I am by no
means to make the return

Certainly not

When Simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice he did not
mean to include that case

Certainly not for he thinks that a friend ought always to do good to a
friend and never evil

You mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injury of
the receiver if the two parties are friends is not the repayment of a
debt that is what you would imagine him to say

Yes

And are enemies also to receive what we owe to them

To be sure he said they are to receive what we owe them and an enemy
as I take it owes to an enemy that which is due or proper to him that
is to say evil

Simonides then after the manner of poets would seem to have spoken
darkly of the nature of justice for he really meant to say that justice
is the giving to each man what is proper to him and this he termed a
debt

That must have been his meaning he said

By heaven I replied and if we asked him what due or proper thing is
given by medicine and to whom what answer do you think that he would
make to us

He would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink to
human bodies

And what due or proper thing is given by cookery and to what

Seasoning to food

And what is that which justice gives and to whom

If Socrates we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the preceding
instances then justice is the art which gives good to friends and evil
to enemies

That is his meaning then

I think so

And who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies
in time of sickness

The physician

Or when they are on a voyage amid the perils of the sea

The pilot

And in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is the just
man most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friend

In going to war against the one and in making alliances with the other

But when a man is well my dear Polemarchus there is no need of a
physician

No

And he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot

No

Then in time of peace justice will be of no use

I am very far from thinking so

You think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war

Yes

Like husbandry for the acquisition of corn

Yes

Or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes that is what you mean

Yes

And what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of
peace

In contracts Socrates justice is of use

And by contracts you mean partnerships

Exactly

But is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and better
partner at a game of draughts

The skilful player

And in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more useful or
better partner than the builder

Quite the reverse

Then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner than
the harpplayer as in playing the harp the harpplayer is certainly a
better partner than the just man

In a money partnership

Yes Polemarchus but surely not in the use of money for you do not
want a just man to be your counsellor in the purchase or sale of a
horse a man who is knowing about horses would be better for that would
he not

Certainly

And when you want to buy a ship the shipwright or the pilot would be
better

True

Then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just man is
to be preferred

When you want a deposit to be kept safely

You mean when money is not wanted but allowed to lie

Precisely

That is to say justice is useful when money is useless

That is the inference

And when you want to keep a pruninghook safe then justice is useful to
the individual and to the state but when you want to use it then the
art of the vinedresser

Clearly

And when you want to keep a shield or a lyre and not to use them you
would say that justice is useful but when you want to use them then
the art of the soldier or of the musician

Certainly

And so of all other things justice is useful when they are useless
and useless when they are useful

That is the inference

Then justice is not good for much But let us consider this further
point Is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxing match or in any
kind of fighting best able to ward off a blow

Certainly

And he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease is
best able to create one

True

And he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a march
upon the enemy

Certainly

Then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief

That I suppose is to be inferred

Then if the just man is good at keeping money he is good at stealing
it

That is implied in the argument
